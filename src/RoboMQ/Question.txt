# Assignment
You are required to complete a program that simulates the functionality of a Load Balancer. A Load Balancer acts as an intermediary between requester and a pool of servers, distributing incoming requests among the available servers based on a predefined strategy. Some of the generally used strategies are Random distribution and Round-Robin Distribution. 

Your task is to:

1. **Implement the Load Balancer and Request Dispatcher** interfaces with logic to assign requests to servers.

2. **Fill in the method implementations** wherever needed in the given code.

3. Ensure that the Load Balancer can support different request distribution strategies such as:
  
    * **Random Strategy**: Assign requests to a randomly selected server.

    * **Round Robin Strategy**: Assign requests sequentially, cycling through the list of servers.

## 🚦 Functional Requirements

* You should be able to add or remove a server by name at runtime (e.g., `"server1"`, `"server2"`). Each server is an object of the **`Server`** Class.
* Send Requests to the Load balancer to test the program. Requests should be made in `Assessment.java` class. Each incoming request has a RequestId. 
* The **`RequestDispatcher`** class should accept incoming requests and dispatch the request using a new Thread per request to the Load Balancer.
* Load Balancer should select server to process the request from the pool based on the distribution strategy. You should implement Round Robin and Random strategies.
* When a Server (Server.java) handles a request, it prints a `Server <server name> started processing request <requestID>` and `Server <server name> finished request <requestID>` log. The server takes some time (random value between 10 to 30 seconds) to process a request.
* Each request must be handled in a **separate thread**.


### Additional Details: 
  * `ROUND_ROBIN` Strategy: Distributes requests sequentially across servers.
  * `RANDOM` Strategy: Distributes requests randomly to any of the available servers. 

## 💰 Bonus requirement

Update the program to define a server property: limit, which defines limit of concurrent requests a server can handle. 
The load balancer should not choose a server if the server is busy (limit of concurrent requests is reached).

## ⚙️ Technical Constraints

* **Only core Java** libraries are allowed. No external frameworks.
* Server and load balancer data structures must be **thread-safe**.
